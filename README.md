# Health-Disease-Diagnostics

## About the Project

A health disease classifier system that predicts whether a patient is suffering from heart disease or not. The Heart Disease Diagnostics project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using advanced machine learning algorithms. This project serves as a reliable and efficient tool for early heart disease detection, assisting healthcare providers and patients in identifying risk factors and making proactive healthcare decisions.

## Key Features

- Utilizes machine learning for predictive analytics
- Comprehensive dataset for robust model training
- Early detection to aid healthcare decision-making

## Dataset

The dataset includes a variety of medical and demographic features, such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG Results
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise-Induced Angina
- Depression by Exercise
- Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment
- Number of Major Blood Vessels
- Thalassemia
